# Sem-6-Implementing-a-Simple-Search-Algorithm-in-Python-Romanian-example-
Implemented two search algorithms: Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS) on a Romanian example, using a graph represented as an adjacency list, and find the shortest/optimal path from a given source node to a given destination node.
